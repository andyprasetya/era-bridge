The next step is seat apportionment based on the known population figure and the number of seats. The population number is converted to seats using the electoral formula. There are many formulas for seat apportionment but the hare quota is commonly used and considered proportionate in its population-to-seat conversion. The steps for calculating the seat quota for electoral districting are set out in a to c below. 

> a. If the legislative seat number in a municipality named ‘Perfect’ is 40 seats, and a population of 1,043,070 is spread over six regions (A to F):

> b. The next step is to calculate the ‘seat quota’ using the hare quota electoral formula:

> - The size of Perfect’s population (1,043,070) ÷ the number of legislative seats in Perfect (40) = the number of citizens for one seat, or the seat quota (26,077)

> c. Next, the ‘population quota’ for each of Perfect’s regions is calculated. 

> - The population in each region ÷ the seat quota (26,077) = the seat allocation or ‘population quota’ in the six regions:

> The six regions now have their own population quotas (i.e. the number of seats it has based on its population).
