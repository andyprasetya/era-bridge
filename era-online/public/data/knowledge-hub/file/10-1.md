In Indonesia, regulations on boundary delimitation change from one election to the next. For the 1999 and 2004 elections, electoral districts for the **national legislative body (the DPR) and the provincial and regency/city level legislative bodies (the DPRDs) were drawn up by the General Election Commission (KPU) of the Republic of Indonesia**. However, for the 2009 and 2014 elections, the **KPU** was stripped of its authority to carry out boundary delimitation for the DPR elections. The **KPU** was only given the authority to conduct boundary delimitation at the provincial and regency/city levels for the DPRD elections. DPR electoral districts were made part of the election law appendix. In the 2019 elections, the **KPU**’s authority over boundary delimitation was narrowed still further to cover electoral districting for the regency/city DPRD elections. DPR and provincial DPRD electoral districts became an inextricable part of Election Law 7/2017.

Election law had not previously governed the principles of electoral districting. The principles of electoral districting governed by Law 7/2017 are: the number of voters per district, compliance with the proportional electoral system, proportionality, district integrality, regional scope, cohesion and contiguity.

The administrative regions used as the basis for electoral districts in Indonesia differ from one level of legislative election to another. For DPR elections, the administrative regions used as a basis for electoral districting are the provinces, the regencies/cities and combined regencies/cities. For the Provincial DPRD elections, the administrative regions that can be turned into electoral districts are the regencies/cities or combined regencies/cities. For the regency/city DPRD elections, the administrative regions used for electoral districts are subdistricts or combined subdistricts. 

Under Indonesia’s system of proportional representation, the minimum seat allocation per district for the 2004 elections was three seats and the maximum was 12 seats . This provision was amended leading up to the 2009 elections, drawing a distinction between the minimums and maximums of allocated seats for the DPR and for the DPRD elections. For the 2009 DPR elections, the minimum seat allocation in an electoral district was three and the maximum was 10. For provincial and regency/city DPRD elections, the minimum seat allocation was three and the maximum was 12.

The number of DPR and DPRD seats as determined by election law 7/2017, which regulated the 2019 Elections, was 575 seats for the DPR, 136 for the DPRD, a minimum of 35 and maximum of 120 for Provincial DPRD, and a minimum of 20 seats and a maximum 55 seats for regency/city DPRD. The number of DPRD seats was based on the population as regulated by the election law (see Figure 7).

For regency/city DPRD elections, the number of allocated seats was also determined based on population size, as set out in Law 7/2017 (see Figure 8).

Problems arose when independent authority for boundary delimitation of the DPR electoral districts at the KPU was moved to a partisan authority formed by the political parties in the legislative body. This partisan body created two electoral districts, South Kalimantan II and West Java III, that did not observe the principles of contiguity and integrality. South Kalimantan II was allocated five seats by combining five regencies/municipalities: Tanah Laut, Tanah Bumbu and Kotabaru Regencies, and Banjarbaru and Banjarmasin Cities. The problem was that Banjarmasin City is entirely separate from the other four. Banjarmasin City is in fact directly connected to Banjar Regency, which is part of the South Kalimantan I electoral district.

A similar situation occurred in the West Java III electoral district, which combines Bogor municipality and Cianjur regency. The two are only connected by air and the combination of these unconnected regions happened because the election law revision for the 2009 elections changed the requirement for a minimum of three seats and maximum of 12 seats per electoral district for the DPR to a minimum of 3 seats and a maximum of 10 seats. 

In the 2004 elections, Bogor Municipality and Bogor Regency had been a single electoral district with an allocation of 11 seats. When the maximum allocated seats per electoral district for DPR was reduced from 12 to 10, Bogor City and Bogor Regency electoral district had to be broken up as it exceeded the limit by one seat. When recalculated, the number of citizens in Bogor City did not meet the minimum three-seat threshold to become an electoral district in its own right, and thus had to be combined with a different regency/city. When discussing revision of the election law, the legislators agreed to combine Bogor City and Cianjur Regency into a single electoral district with a seat allocation of nine.

The discussion on electoral districting behind closed doors by political parties that were to contest many of the electoral districts was seen as the main source of the problem that created two electoral districts that were in violation of electoral districting principles. At the same time, electoral districting for the regency/city DPRD elections under the KPU’s authority was done in an open and participative manner. The KPU took eight steps when conducting DPRD election boundary delimitation:

1.	The KPU submitted a request for the most recent citizenship data in the form of aggregate citizenship data per subdistrict from the Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA). The MoHA had to give the data to the KPU at the latest 16 months before election day.
2.	Based on the updated citizenship data from the MoHA, the KPU determined the number of residents in the regencies/cities. Based on this data, the KPU then determined the number of regency/city DPRD seats based on the provisions of Law 7/2017.
3.	The seat quota was determined by dividing the total population by the number of seats.
4.	Seat allocation per subdistrict was calculated by dividing population per subdistrict by the seat quota.
5.	Electoral districts were then based on the calculated seat allocation per subdistrict.
6.	Seat allocation was then determined for each electoral district.
7.	In cases where there were seats left unallocated, a second round of seat allocations was conducted.

In the 2019 elections, there were 2,206 electoral districts for the regency/city DPRD elections, in which 17,610 seats were contested.¹⁴ For the DPRD electoral districting, the KPU developed an Electoral District Information System (Sidapil). Using Sidapil, the regency/city KPU created recommended electoral districts and seat allocations for the regency/city DPRDs according to the principles of electoral districting. The provincial KPU then supervised, assessed and recapitulated the recommended electoral districts and seat allocations of the regency/city KPU. For the recapitulation, the KPU RI assessed, compiled and determined the electoral districts and seat allocations for the regency/city DPRD elections.¹⁵

Sidapil has been used since the 2014 elections¹⁶ to determine the electoral districts for the provincial and regency/city DPRD elections.¹⁷ Developed in-house by the KPU, Sidapil is equipped with an analysis feature that can calculate the average population and the average seat divider number for a region. Sidapil therefore meets at least two of the principles of electoral districting: vote strength equality and proportionality.¹⁸

With features that can calculate the average population and average seat divider number of a region, electoral districting is guaranteed to meet the vote strength fairness and equality criteria and to achieve proportionality of the election results. The digital process also makes electoral districting easier, more effective and more efficient, and the resulting districts more accountable. Furthermore, the electoral district-based information maintained by the Sidapil data also upholds the principle of transparency in an election. With electoral district-based information, the public can see data on electoral district scope, electoral district seat allocation, candidate lists, voter lists and election administrators.
