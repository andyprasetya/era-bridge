The Constitutional Monarchy of Malaysia implements is a bicameral national legislature with a Senate (*Dewan Negara*) and a House of Representatives (*Dewan Rakyat*). The Senate has 70 members, 44 of whom are appointed by the King and 26 appointed from the regional legislatures. The 219 members of the *Dewan Rakyat* are directly elected using the first past the post (FPTP) plurality system based on single-member constituencies.³⁴ There are 13 states and three federal regions in Malaysia.³⁵ 

The *Dewan Rakyat*’s electoral districts are formed on the recommendations of the Election Commission according to six main rules governed by the federal constitution:

1.	Electoral redistricting cannot be carried out more than once every eight years; 
2.	The electoral redistricting process must not take more than two years;
3.	Electoral district boundaries must take account of federal regional boundaries;
4.	The administrative facilities available in the electoral districts must be taken into account;
5.	The number of voters in each electoral district must be more or less equal, unless there are issues around difficult voter access;³⁶
6.	Attention must be paid to the problems associated with electoral districting, and the cohesion of local communities must be taken into account.

The mechanism for electoral redistricting in Malaysia is as follows:

1.	The Election Commission publishes its electoral redistricting proposals in the State Gazette and in at least one newspaper distributed in each electoral district;
2.	A copy of the proposed electoral districts is displayed for public scrutiny in every electoral district;
3.	The deadline for feedback on the electoral district design is one month after publication by the Election Commission. The Commission can receive representations from state governments, local authorities or a body consisting of 100 or more objectors whose names are listed on the current voter list in the respective electoral district;
4.	The Commission investigates the objections or recommendations of stakeholders;
5.	If the Election Commission revises the recommended designs after issuing a notice, the Commission will adhere to the revised designs as if there had been no previously issued notice, so long as there is no need to hold more than two local investigations on the same design.

Following completion of the above procedure, the Election Commission submits the recommended electoral district design to the prime minister. The recommendation contains an overview of the proposed electoral redistricting according to electoral districting principles and the names of the experts who support the design, or the names of the experts who state that no redistricting is necessary.

After the recommendation has been submitted to the prime minister, the Election Commission presents its recommendations to the *Dewan Rakyat*. If the design is approved by a simple majority vote, the prime minister submits the recommendations to the King.

As noted above, the Federal Constitution allows disproportionate rural district magnitudes. However, the politicization of district magnitude determination by the ruling party undermines the principle of ‘one person; one vote; one value’ that is crucial to ensuring equal voting rights in elections.

The ACE Project has reported that the *Barisan Nasional* (BN) coalition, which has been in power for more than half a century, has worked with the Election Commission³⁷ to form electoral districts that are in line with the party coalition’s interests, particularly those of the United Malays National Organization. Rural states that are constitutionally allowed to be given a larger number of seats are largely populated by Malay supporters of the BN coalition. As a result, disproportionate electoral district magnitudes and seat allocations cause inequalities in voting rights that benefit the parties in the BN coalition. In the 2004 elections, for example, BN obtained 60 per cent of the national vote but won 90 percent of the parliamentary seats.
