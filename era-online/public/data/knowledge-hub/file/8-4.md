Having calculated the seats apportioned to each region based on its population, the next step is to begin drawing the electoral district. In drawing the electoral district, it is important to consider the principles of proportionality, contiguity, compactness and cohesiveness in order to build a representative electoral district. Spatial and geographical data are extremely important when drawing electoral districts. Whether there is a population deviation standard in the legal framework will have to be checked. Furthermore, if the existing legal framework implements special provisions for minority groups, special electoral districts will have to be formed for those minorities. Another aspect to be aware of is whether the allowable district magnitude is a definite number or a range. If such a provision exists, then regions or combinations that do not reach the minimum district magnitude will need to be combined with others. The model below illustrates how to draw an electoral district based on the municipality of ‘Perfect’ in the above example (see Figure 3). 

**Figure 3** Illustration of compactness

- In delimiting electoral district boundaries for Perfect’s legislative elections, the electoral law framework specifies that the district magnitude is a minimum of 7 seats and maximum of 15 seats per electoral district. 
- Of the six regions within Perfect, two do not meet the minimum of seven seats to be an electoral district and must be combined with other regions. 
- In the process of drawing and combining the regions, it is important to consider the regions’ boundaries and the number of seats if combined, in order to create equal, proportionate, contiguous and compact electoral districts.
