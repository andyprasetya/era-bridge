In order to uphold the principles of cohesiveness and preserving community interests, the social, cultural, economic and historical aspects of a region are very important in electoral districting. Demography is an important element of ensuring that a certain region is socially, culturally and economically cohesive and can be formed or combined into an electoral district. Electoral districts must reflect the context of community interests. 

Community interests can be defined as the shared interests and values of a community. These have usually been built up over a long period, and influenced by shared history, culture, ethnicity and professions. Three factors ensure shared interests: 

- a shared racial or ethnic background; 
- a common history and/or culture;
- a common religion or language;
- a shared socio-economic status.¹² 

Preserving a community’s interest is often ignored in electoral districting, which places emphasis on population size and geographical context. Election laws in Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea and Australia specifically require electoral districting to consider ‘community and diversity of interest’ or the ‘homogeneity and heterogeneity of the community’. In Germany, the legal framework states that electoral districting must be coherent.
