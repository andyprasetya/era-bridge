Technology has an important role to play in the process of boundary delimitation. Technology can be used to ensure proportionality and enforce deviation standards in seat apportionment, while also helping to maintain contiguous, compact and cohesive districts. Geographic Information Systems (GIS), for example, ease the process of drawing the electoral district by paying attention to topography and area boundaries, so that the drawing process can be in line with the principles of electoral districting. The electoral knowledge network lists four technological tools that should be considered when conducting boundary delimitation:

- A computer (preferably a desktop) 
- Spreadsheet or database software, or GIS software
- Population and, if desired, historical election results data available in electronic form; if only paper copies are available, the data will have to be keypunched into the computer program 
- Either paper maps, or digitized maps if GIS software is being used¹³

Electoral Redistricting Application (ERA) software is specially designed for electoral redistricting (see the Tutorial Videos and Manual).
