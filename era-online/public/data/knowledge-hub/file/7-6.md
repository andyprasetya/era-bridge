Minority groups are often ignored in electoral districting, removing or reducing these groups’ political representation. To protect the interests of minority groups and ensure their representation, affirmative action can be taken to form a special electoral district. Such special treatment for minority groups occurs in several countries, taking various approaches: 

- **Singapore** requires all political parties to register at least one member from a minority group (Indian, Malay, Eurasian) in every multi-member electoral district;
- **Mauritius** has eight allocated seats in specially formed electoral districts for minority groups based on religion and ethnicity, such as Hindu, Muslim, Chinese or Creole;
- **Pakistan** divides seats into three categories: 272 general seats, 60 seats for women and 10 seats for non-Muslims;
- **New Zealand** forms a special electoral district for the Māori people.
