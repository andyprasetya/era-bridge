Boundary delimitation, or the way in which the borders of electoral districts are drawn, also influences proportionality in election results. For this reason, electoral districting must always be in line with various principles. Many political scientists have attempted to theorize the basic principles of electoral districting. Thomas L. Brunell sets out five basic principles for optimal electoral districting: 

1.	An electoral district is a contiguous region, and electoral districting must therefore observe the contiguity of the area. Every point in an electoral district must be accessible from every other point in that electoral district without having to leave the district. 
2.	Equal population, so that the worth of every seat in an electoral district is equal to that of any other district. The OPOVOV principle is paramount in forming electoral districts. Political equality means that every vote has the same value, and no voter’s vote is valued more or less than that of any other voter.
3.	Electoral districting must preserve communities of interest by combining areas with similar social conditions for their citizens in an electoral district.
4.	Preserve political/administrative subdivisions where existing administrative subdivisions are used as building blocks for creating electoral districts. This is a less strenuous process, but may make equal suffrage more difficult to achieve or maintain.
5.	The compactness of electoral districts makes communication within the districts easier as distances to the centre of the district more or less equal.³

In addition to these principles, the basic principles of equality of people’s political rights and representation mean that electoral districting must be carried out in such a way that constituents can vote for a candidate who truly represents the common interests of their district. Such interests can be defined in various ways, for instance, a community that exists in a geographical area with commonly recognized administrative borders or physical features, such as mountains or rivers. Communities can also be defined by observing similarities of race, ethnicity, tribal background or language. If an electoral district is not based on these considerations, it can be more difficult to represent the people in it. The Ace Project has defined several principles that are often observed by the world’s nations and should be observed during boundary delimitation:⁴

#### Representativeness 

Boundary delimitation give voters the chance to vote for a candidate who truly represents them. This means that boundary delimitation must observe communities of interest, which can be defined in various ways, such as geographically, based on the administrative or physical boundaries of the area, or where a community has the same characteristics, ethnicity, language or religion. 

#### Equal value of a vote (Equal suffrage)

Boundary delimitation should ensure that every electoral district has an equal number of voters or inhabitants. Electoral districts with an equal number of potential voters give voters an equal influence in choosing their representative. Electoral districts with large differences in population diminish the quality of democracy as ideally each vote must have an approximately equal impact. 

#### Independent, impartial boundary authority

The legal framework that governs electoral districting must require that the person or institution authorized to conduct boundary delimitation is independent. In addition, it is recommended that boundary delimitation is not the responsibility of the government or legislative body. If political groups are allowed to be involved in the process, then all political parties must receive equal access, and the rules and regulations on boundary delimitation must be understood as a whole and accepted by all political parties. 

#### Transparency

Delimitation of the boundaries of electoral districts has a big political impact. The boundary delimitation process needs to be transparent to ensure its acceptability and legitimacy. Clear methods and procedures for boundary delimitation must be set out from the start. The involvement of the general public to comment on and provide input throughout the process is therefore also important. 

#### Non-discrimination

Boundary delimitation cannot be done with the objective of discriminating in favour of or against certain minority groups. For example, drawing district boundaries along ethnic lines risks benefiting one group over others. 

In her study on boundary delimitation and the norms and standards of election administration,⁵ Lisa Handley laid out several basic principles and best practices of boundary delimitation (see Table 1).
