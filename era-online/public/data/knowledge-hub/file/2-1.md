In general terms, an electoral district is defined as a physical political area in an election that connects political candidates/parties with voters. Electoral districts are one of the most important variables in an electoral system and often differentiate one electoral system from another. The electoral system, generally defined, constitutes the rules concerning the process of converting votes into seats. This means that district magnitude as a system variable influences how the input of the total number of votes obtained by each candidate/party is converted into the number of seats obtained by that party. There are four variables in any electoral system.

#### A. District magnitude

The term ‘district magnitude’ was popularized by US political scientist Douglas W. Rae in his essay, *The Political Consequences of Electoral Laws* (1967). District magnitude refers to the number of seats allocated to each electoral district. According to Rae, district magnitude is one of the ‘three basic dimensions of electoral systems’, the two other being: (a) the electoral formula, or the mathematical formula for converting votes into seats; and (b) ballot structure, or the instructions printed on ballots on how to vote and describing the election participants.

District magnitude is one of the most important features of electoral systems. The number of seats (one or more) serves as the strength of the competition, as well as an estimate of how many participants will be involved. One seat per electoral district is commonly used for executive elections, such as presidential, gubernatorial or mayoral elections. Because legislative bodies serve representative functions, however, they require more seats per electoral district. District magnitude also has a direct impact on the type of electoral system. One seat per electoral district generally means a plurality majority system, even though more than one seat is allocated to an electoral district in several variants of plurality majority. Where there are two or more seats per electoral district, the system is usually based on proportional representation (PR). Categorizing the number of seats (one or more) provides variants of the plurality majority system and variants of the PR system.

Overly large district magnitudes can present problems with conducting elections. In countries with multi-member districts that require the names of every candidate to be included on the ballot, such as for Indonesia’s lower house (the open-list PR system) and Australia’s upper house (which is elected using the system of single transferrable vote), a large district magnitude would create a large and potentially complicated ballot. One ballot could potentially contain the names of hundreds of political parties and candidates.

#### B. Electoral Formula 

The vote conversion formula is also a direct consequence of district magnitude. Single seat elections use the plurality/majority electoral system. This means one of two generally possible conversion formulas. First, the seat is won by the participant with the most votes, no matter how many, and this means the conversion formula follows plurality. Second, the seat is won by the participant with more than 50% of the votes, and the conversion formula follows majority. If the district magnitude is more than two seats, then a proportional system is usually used, the exception being the block vote system which uses plurality. Systems with multiple seats and an objective of proportionality generally have more complex and diverse vote-to-seat conversion formulas. Generally speaking, these are categorized in two groups: enumeration and quota. 

#### C. Electoral Thresholds

Electoral thresholds are not generally directly related to district magnitude. This electoral system variable is usually implemented in proportional systems. They take the form of a minimum vote percentage that a political party or group contesting the elections must obtain in order to have its votes converted into seats.

#### D. Election schedule (Concurrency of Elections) 

Election schedules are also not directly related to district magnitude. The emphasis is usually on how legislative and executive elections are grouped at the central/ federal level and local/state levels. Within these groupings, election schedules can be categorized by:

- Separating or combining elections based on the type of elected office: executive or legislative;
- Separating or combining elections based on the levels of administration: central/federal and local/state;
- All types of offices and all levels of administration elected in a single combined electoral event.

Within these categorizations, it is important to consider the number of elected seats. Generally, as executive elections only have one seat per electoral district, combining all executive elections in one schedule would not complicate matters. Combining all legislative elections into one schedule, however, would require highly complicated election administration. 

Presidential systems of government with multiparty parliaments have experience of combining a presidential election with the national parliamentary election. Electoral system researchers have identified a coat-tail effect when the presidential election and the national parliamentary election are conducted in a single election schedule. However, combined elections are not successful in all countries. Brazil, Indonesia and the Philippines are examples of failure, one reason being that their parliamentary district magnitudes were too large. Uruguay is one of the few countries where it was a success, due, among other things, to the implementation of smaller district magnitudes.
