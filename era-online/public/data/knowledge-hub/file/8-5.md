Having drawn the electoral districts, the next step is to undertake public consultations with the various parties concerned, such as political parties, citizen and community groups, election observers, the governmental institutions in charge of citizenship and spatial mapping, and so on. This public consultation is important for obtaining inputs on the draft electoral districts, to assess whether they have met the standards and principles of electoral districting.
