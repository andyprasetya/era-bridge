Geography is another key influence on electoral districting. Geographical context is paramount in determining the administrative boundaries of an electoral district, specifically to maintain its contiguity and compactness. The Electoral Knowledge Network (Ace Project) makes two points in relation to the geographical context of electoral districting: on geographical boundaries and geographical size or shape.

In many countries, the geographical criteria that make regions eligible to become an electoral district are specifically governed by electoral law, and include whether they are part of specific administrative regions such as provinces or municipalities. However, specific criteria regarding the area’s topography (islands, mountains/hills, rivers and highway access) also apply. 

In the United States, the geographical context is set by the census bureau in its Topographically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER), with regard to: 

- Visible geographic features such as roads, rivers and railways; 
- A whole hierarchy of census geographic units (e.g., census blocks, block groups and census tracts) for the collection and reporting of population data;
- The boundaries of administrative subdivisions such as counties, cities and towns;
- Political geography, such as congressional districts and, in some cases, voting areas, or election precincts.¹¹
